          In the “Beningin” there were 50 founding tribes of Africa, 28 were
          launched first to start the 1st generation,and those 29 each
          multiplied by 14 to become 490 strong and courageous GINS.

          They are called GINs and BENINGIN is their movement, a movement to
          educate and remind Africans of the riches they hold in their lands and
          in their mind and in their heart.
